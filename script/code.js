// variable
// a name of storage location.

// value
// The value property sets or returns the value of the value attribute of a text field.

// Data type
// In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null

// initialization
// Storing a value in a variable

// difference between let var and const 

// let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used.

// var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

// const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant and tells the compiler to prevent the programmer from modifying it.

// what is a variable scope 
// The scope of a variable is the block of code in the entire program where the variable is declared, used, and can be modified.

// When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach and do while loop?

// A for Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a number of times that is known.
// A while Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times until the conditions are met.
// A foreach loop is used when you need to operate on each item individually in an array.
// A do while loop is used in all scenarios where the loop body needs to be executed at least once.

// Define hoisting and variable scoping?

// Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
// varible scope
// refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript.
